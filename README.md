# aggregator-contracts

This is a repository for the aggregator contracts.
The contracts are written in Solidity and are used to aggregate data from multiple sources. We created these contracts based on the forked source code from the Kyber Aggregator on Base chain ([0x6131b5fae19ea4f9d964eac0408e4408b66337b5](https://basescan.org/address/0x6131b5fae19ea4f9d964eac0408e4408b66337b5#code)).

Currently, the contracts are deployed on the Story Aeneid Network and are available at the address [0x01B6D4C8c881193DDBC88396D3d54aA45ae79eBd](https://aeneid.storyscan.io/address/0x01B6D4C8c881193DDBC88396D3d54aA45ae79eBd).
